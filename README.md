# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

## Summary
**In 1-2 sentences, explain the problem statement: e.g "This dataset contains data about... we seek to predict..."**

This dataset contains data about bank telemarketing. The dataset has 21 columns and about 32000 rows. We're trying to predict the column named 'y' which has two class possibilities (yes, no). There is heavy class imbalance in the dataset. There are less than 3200 'yes' records which accounts to around 10% of the total rows.

**In 1-2 sentences, explain the solution: e.g. "The best performing model was a ..."**

The best performing model was a VotingEnsemble model built by AutoML. This has an accuracy of 91.72%. The model used the engineered features. The numerical features were imputed using the mean and the categorical were label encoded and vectorized.

## Scikit-learn Pipeline
**Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.**

**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**

**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**

## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**

## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**

## Future work
**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**
